This project is a **Rock-Paper-Scissors game with an adaptive AI opponent**.  
It includes two modes:  
1. **AI Tournament Mode** – Your bot competes against 4 predefined AI bots over 1000 rounds each.  
2. **Human vs AI Mode** – Play interactively against the smart AI from your terminal.

##  Features
- **Adaptive AI**: Uses pattern recognition (Markov chain) and special-case detection (e.g., vs Kris).  
- **Tournament Mode**: Your AI plays 1000 rounds against Quincy, Abbey, Kris, and Mrugesh.  
- **Human Mode**: Challenge the AI directly with your own moves.  
- **Modular Code**: Separated into `main.py`, `RPS.py`, and `RPS_game.py` for clarity.  
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Simple to run, well-documented, and easy to extend.

## ▶ How to Run
Make sure you have **Python 3.8+** installed. Then:

```bash
# Run the project
python main.py
You will see a menu:

Enter 1 → Play Tournament Mode (AI vs 4 bots).
Enter 2 → Play Human vs AI Mode.

# Opponent Bots
Quincy → Cycles through [R, P, S, R, P].
Abbey → Predicts based on your 2nd-last move.
Kris → Random but skewed distribution.
Mrugesh → Plays your most common move in the last 10 rounds.

# AI Strategy (Your Bot)
Starts with fixed moves to gather data.
Detects if the opponent is “Kris” (counters your last move).
Uses Markov chain prediction to model opponent patterns.
Falls back to a cycle strategy if no data is available.

# Future Improvements
Add GUI/Web version with buttons for Rock/Paper/Scissors.
Add more opponent bots with advanced strategies.
Track leaderboards & analytics (win %, longest streaks, etc.).
Multiplayer mode (human vs human online).
